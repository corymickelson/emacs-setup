;;; Package --- Summary
;;; Commentary:

    ;; These customizations change the way Emacs looks and disable/enable
    ;; some user interface elements.  Some useful customizations are
    ;; commented out, and begin with the line "CUSTOMIZE".  These are more
    ;; a matter of preference and may require some fiddling to match your
    ;; preferences
